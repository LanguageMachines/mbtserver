.SH NAME
mbtserver \- Tilburg Memory Based Tagger Server
.SH SYNOPSYS

mbtserver [server options]

or

mbtserver \-s settingsfile \-S portnumber
.B (deprecated)


.SH DESCRIPTION
mbtserver extends
.B mbt
with a server layer. It provided the possibility to access a trained tagger
from multiple sessions. It also allows one to run and access different taggers
in parallel.

.SH OPTIONS

.BR \-h " or " \-\-help
.RS
show help
.RE

.BR \-\-config=file
.RS
read the settings for one or more taggers from the specified configuration file.

A configuration file
.I must
contain a port specification:

port=<number>

It
.I may
provide a limit to the number of parallel connections:

maxconn=<number>

And it
.I must
give one or more mbt tagger descriptions:

<base>=<mbt options line>

The <base> is a basename for the Tagger that will be started with the options
specified. The basename is needed because it is possible to start several (different)
taggers. When accessing the server, we need a way to tell which Tagger we want
to use.
In general, the mbt options line will just be something like:
"\-s <settingsfile>", where settingsfile is a file generated by
.B mbtg

example config file:
.RS
.nf
port=4567
maxconn=15
test1 = \-s tests/eindh.set
another = \-s tests/wotan.set
.fi
