.SH NAME
MbtServer - Tilburg Memory Based Tagger Server
.SH SYNOPSYS

MbtServer [server options]

or

MbtServer -s settingsfile -S portnumber
.B (deprecated)


.SH DESCRIPTION
MbServer extends 
.B Mbt
with a server layer. It provided the possibility to access a trained tagger
from multiple sessions. It also alows to run and access different taggers in
parallel.

.SH OPTIONS

.BR --config =file
.RS
read the settings for one or more taggers from the specified file

A configfile 
.I must
contain a port specification:

port=<number>

It 
.I may
provide a limit to the number of parallel connections:

maxconn=<number>

And it 
.I must
give one or more Mbt tagger descriptions:

<base>=<Mbt options line>

The <base> is a basename for the Tagger that will be started with the options 
specified. It is needed because it is possible to start several (different) 
taggers. When accessing the server, we need a way to tell which Tagger we want
to use.
In general, the Mbt options line will just be something like: 
"-s <settingsfile>", where settingsfile is a file generated by
.B Mbtg

example config file:
.RS
.nf
port=4567
maxconn=15
test1 = -s tests/eindh.set
another = -s tests/wotan.set
.fi
